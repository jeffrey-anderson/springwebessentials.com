        <h2>Building modern web services with Spring Boot</h2>
        <p>Thanks to each of you who purchased Spring Web Essentials, a full-length e-book that taught readers how to
          build modern, industrial-grade web services with Spring Boot and support JavaScript frameworks like
          Angular, React, and Vue. Since I am no longer using the book in my teaching curriculum, I have decided to
          retire it. Keeping up with new versions of Spring and Java is a challenge, and I don't have the time,
          especially since I have switched to <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> for developing back-end web services.
          For posterity, you can visit
          the <a href="https://leanpub.com/springwebessentials">product page on Lean Pub.</a></p>
          <p>Thanks again for your support, and happy computing!</p>

      <h2>About the author</h2>
      <p>For as long as he can remember, Jeff has been fascinated by gadgets. His all-time favorite Christmas gift was a Science Fair 100-in-1 Kit because, with each project he tried, he learned more about how electronic components work together to make something useful.</p>
      <p>The knowledge he gained building "space-age" electronics in the 1970s set his path as a lifelong author, student, teacher, enterprise IT architect, software developer, and data geek. He is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy Accredited Instructor and has held multiple AWS certifications, including Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Professional, and Security Specialty. When he logs out, he loves motorcycle riding, camping, traveling, and racing.</p>
      <p>His career spans four decades in many roles, including developer, lead developer, application architect, infrastructure architect, data architect, and, most recently, educator. In the early days, his favorite programming language was Pascal and, most recently, Go. He will always have a soft spot in his heart for Java. He wrote his first Java program in 1997 and spent the next fifteen years using it to develop websites, web services, and other software for a Fortune 100 company. Now, he is a lead solutions architect and big data engineer at a global data and analytics company and an adjunct professor at Columbus State Community College.</p>
