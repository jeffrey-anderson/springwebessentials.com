      <h2>Who should read this book?</h2>
      <p>If you want to learn how to develop modern web applications with Spring, this book is for you. Part one covers using Spring to power secure application programming interfaces (APIs) for a web application built with a modern Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Javascript front end. In part two, we develop a more traditional server-side HTML web application.</p>
      <h2>About the author</h2>
      <p>For as long as he can remember, Jeff has been fascinated by gadgets. His all-time favorite Christmas gift was a Science Fair 100 in 1 Kit, because, with each project he tried, he learned more about how electronic components work together to make something useful.</p>
      <p>The knowledge he gained building "space-age" electronics in the 1970s set his path as a lifelong author, student, teacher, enterprise IT architect, software developer, and data geek. He is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy Accredited Instructor and holds three AWS certifications: Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate, and Security Specialty. When he logs out, he loves motorcycle riding, camping, traveling, and racing.</p>
      <p>His career spans four decades in many roles, including developer, lead developer, application architect, infrastructure architect, and, most recently, data architect and educator. In the early days, his favorite programming language was Pascal and, most recently, [Go](https://golang.org/). He wrote his first Java program in 1997 and spent the next fifteen years developing websites for a Fortune 100 company. Now, he teaches Java for Columbus State Community College.</p>

      <h2>Why this book and not some other Spring book on the market?</h2>
      <p>The first version of Spring came out in 2003 when Java lacked many of the capabilities that make it a great language today, like generics, annotations, and variable arguments. As the language brought more natural ways of doing things, Spring improved to take advantage of them.</p>
      <p>Strong backward compatibility is one of the five major <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.3.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#overview-philosophy">design philosophies</a> of Spring, but it also means there are new, older, and much older ways of doing things. Documenting all of them makes for thick books. As a teacher, my reading assignments often had a longer list of what to skip than what to read. My focus for this book is current best practices covering what you need to know with mentions and references to the older ways of doing things.</p>
      <p>Second, older books don't cover the magic that is <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>, which significantly simplifies configuring and running Spring applications. It's no longer an arduous task to get a Spring application up and running, so why should you learn how to do lots of unnecessary work?</p>
      <p>Finally, newer books cover Spring boot but often lack the level of detail needed to deploy real applications to production, including unit tests, bean validation, and security. This book presents a complete example leaving you ready to work on industrial-grade Spring applications.</p>
